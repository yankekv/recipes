Ingredients

1 pound of ham
3 medium potatoes
4 medium carrots.
1 (15 oz) can sweet peas, drained
5 boiled eggs
5 medium-large pickles (I use Vlasic)
⅓ cup chopped green onion
¼ cup chopped fresh dill
¾ cup to 1 cup mayo (to taste)
Salt and Pepper (to taste)

Instructions

In the same pot, boil whole unpeeled potatoes and carrots for about 30 minutes, or until knife pierces them smoothly. Don't let them get too soft.
In a separate pot put eggs in salted cold water. Bring to a boil, turn it off and leave it on the same burner with the lid on for 15 minutes. Cool them down in cold water.
Remove the vegetables and eggs from boiling water and allow them to cool to room temperature prior to chopping.
Skin the boiled potatoes and carrots with a small knife. It's easier to skin the carrots if you make a slit down the length of the carrot and skin in a circle around the carrot.
Chop ham, potatoes, carrots, pickles and eggs into equal size dice (pea size).
Mix together potatoes, carrots, pickles, eggs, green onion, dill and mayo. Add more mayo, Salt and pepper to taste.
Fold in the peas last so they aren't crushed. If you prefer more onion, pickles, or anything else; add more. Its easy to modify this recipe!
